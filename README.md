# UFOs

## Overview 
The purpose of this project was to create a functional and dynamic webpage, where users could search for UFO sightings based on multiple search criteria. The UFO data is contained in a javascript file. Javascript as well as HTML were leveraged to pull data from the javascript dataset, create the ability to filter the data by specific conditions and display the information in a well organized webpage.

## Results
To search for UfO sightings, users can enter a value in the 'Date', 'City', 'State', 'Country' or 'Shape' field, and the table with populate with results matching the specified criteria.

Upon initially entering the site, the table displays all the data from every UFO sighting.

The user can then begin to narrow their search by entering a value in the filter search fields. For example, if the user enters a date of 1/10/2010, and then clicks anywhere on the page, the table will filter to show only UFO sightings that were recorded on the specified date.

The user can then enter values in the additional filter fields to further narrow their search results. For example, if 'sphere' is entered in the shape field, the table will populate to show sightings that meet both criteria of being recorded on 1/10/2010, as well as in the shape of a sphere.

The user can enter as many, or as few search results as desired, and the table will updated accordingly to show sightings that match all specified criteria.

If no search criteria is enter, or all previously entered criteria is removed, the table will display all UFO sightings. 

## Summary
One drawback of the webpage is there is no button for the user to press once they have entered their search criteria, therefore it can be difficult to decipher when and how the changes will take effect. Adding a button could improve the functionality and user experience of the site. Additionally, a dropdown menu that provides a list of options for each filter category would also be useful to help guide the user in their selections.
